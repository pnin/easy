I had ordered Huion's HS64 from Amazon some days ago. It works pretty well. I liked the pen's grip, the tablet feels sturdy, but there are some tiny scratches already. I will be creating some stuff with it till I run out of nibs (8 of them available in the box), only after which I would be mentally ready for an Apple pencil kind of commitment.
